This is a capstone project for an intensive C++ training course I completed last year. It uses C++/CLI which is a language specification created by Microsoft and OpenCV library. OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. I developed this basic application to teach myself C++/CLI and the basics of OpenCV. As I learn more about OpenCV I will be adding more functionality to this application. Please note that the main purpose of the application is educational and it contains source code from various OpenCV books and OpenCV web site. In order to use it, you will need to setup OpenCV library to use it with Visual studio. Please refer to the following tutorial to learn how to do that:
