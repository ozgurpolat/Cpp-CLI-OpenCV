Demo: Download [OpenCV_CPP.exe](https://github.com/ozgurpolat/Cpp-CLI-OpenCV/blob/master/OpenCV_CPP/x64/Debug/OpenCV_CPP.exe)

This is a capstone project for an intensive C++ training course I completed last year. It uses C++/CLI which is a language specification and OpenCV library which is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. I developed this application to integrate C++/CLI with OpenCV. In order to use the app, you will need to setup OpenCV library with Visual studio. Refer to the following tutorial for the installation instructions:
